# Graph-Cycles
Program that finds cycles in a sparse graph using BFS.

The users inserts a template sparse graph, then chooses to find either the spanning tree starting from a source using Breadth-First Search, or find one cycle for each edge that creates a cycle.

After the template graph is inserted, only user-input edges can be inserted. For the initial template graph to be inserted again, the program must be re-executed.
